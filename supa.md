Authentication/database: we are going to use supabase for backend, authentication and database. And we are using stripe for payments. So here is how the authentication workflow will be: When i create an account, i get an verification email and proceed to click it and have my account verified. Then, i log in because my account is verified. If i create an account with an email that is already verified, i should get a message saying that my account is already created and then tells me to log in. Once, i log in, the websote will ask for my name which is required. Then it will ask for my phone number which is optional. Once i enter my name (and phone number depending if the users did it or not), it will get stored in the database in the users table. So in the users table, it should show their email, account id, name, phone number and other info that subase aready has built in. Btw, there are no free trials in my saas. There is a free plan, or a paid one for 10$ a month. So in the users table, it should also display what type of user they are if they are paid or free. and then there is an admin user which is me. I should be able to controll which user has which role manually. btw i will ad the billing, and paid users role funconality later at the end of the saas, so dont worry about thta now. So when a free user subscribse to the paid plan, their role changes into paid.
