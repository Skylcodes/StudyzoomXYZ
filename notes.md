Okay now, I need you to implement the notes feature for the documents. So here is how it works:   on the documents, there will be a button where you can add notes. You can type whatever you want in the notes box.  Then after you make the notes. The notes will get saved for that document. And on the lefthand sidebar, under library, there is a button/empty pgae called team. I need you to rename that to notes, then that will be the new pgae where notes will get stored. You can see all the notes, and you can view and edit the notes there, and the document will be linked to each note, so you can click on the document and it will take you there.
