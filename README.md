## üßë‚Äçüíª Key Workflows

### 1. **User Authentication & Onboarding**
- **Signup/Login:** Email/password and Google OAuth via Supabase
- **Email Verification:** Required before login
- **Onboarding:** After first login, user must provide name (required) and phone (optional) before accessing protected routes
- **User Profile:** Stored in `public.users` table, includes id, email, name, phone, role (`free`, `paid`, `admin`), timestamps
- **Role Management:** Admin can manually set roles; Stripe webhooks auto-upgrade to `paid` on successful payment

### 2. **Document Upload & Processing**
- **Supported Files:** PDF, PPTX, DOCX, TXT, images (JPEG, PNG, TIFF), video/audio (future), ZIP archives
- **Upload UX:** Drag-and-drop, file picker, batch upload, chunked/resumable uploads, progress bars, error handling
- **Parsing Pipeline:** OCR for images/PDFs, text extraction for docs, video/audio transcription (future)
- **AI Tool Generation:** After parsing, system generates flashcards, quizzes, summaries, podcasts, and videos for each document

### 3. **AI Chatbots**
- **General Chatbot:** Accessible anywhere, acts as a study buddy/tutor
- **Document Chatbot:** Tied to each uploaded document, answers questions based on that content only

### 4. **Study Planner**
- **Calendar:** Users input classes, test dates, and weak areas; AI builds and adjusts a study plan
- **Reminders:** Automated, based on deadlines and user progress

### 5. **Dashboard & Analytics**
- **Dashboard:** Shows metrics (users, conversions, revenue, active users), recent activity, and quick actions
- **User Profile:** Tracks streaks, badges, XP, and progress

### 6. **Payments & Subscription**
- **Stripe Integration:** Buy button, webhook for subscription events, role updates in DB
- **Plans:** Free and $10/month paid plan (no free trial)
- **Admin Controls:** Manual role management for users

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Supabase Storage Issues

If you see errors like "No storage buckets found" or "The 'documents' bucket was not found":

1. **Check the browser console for detailed debug output.**
   - The app now logs the full response and errors from Supabase Storage API calls.
   - Look for lines starting with `[Storage Check]` for step-by-step diagnostics.

2. **Verify your environment variables:**
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` must match the project where you created the bucket.

3. **Confirm the bucket exists:**
   - In the Supabase Dashboard, the bucket must be named exactly `documents` (all lowercase).

4. **Check your storage policies:**
   - Use the policies from `supabase/DASHBOARD_STORAGE_SETUP.md`.
   - For debugging, you can add a permissive policy: `bucket_id = 'documents'` for ALL operations and authenticated users.

5. **Manual override for debugging:**
   - Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SKIP_STORAGE_CHECK=true` in your `.env.local` to bypass the storage check (for development only).

6. **Restart your dev server** after any `.env.local` changes.

7. **Log out and log back in** to refresh your session.

If you still have issues, copy the debug output from the console and share it for further help.
