Okay so we already have the document upload system complete. Now we need to polish the library page and make it PRODUCTIVE. So lets start off with the tags feature. Basically in the library you can add a tag to a document. For example a user adds a tag called math to one of her documents, then she can add another document into the math tag. So then, she can use the atgs feature as one of the filter buttons. So if she licks on tags as a filter, then it will display all the existing tags, and she selects the match tag, the only the documents in that tag will get displayed. And you have assign a document to multple tags. I need you to implement this feature/functinoality into our library section in a ROBUST MANNER. Using the context of the surrounding relevant files, you mustimplement this feature in a way where it is 100% fuinctional with NO errors.
